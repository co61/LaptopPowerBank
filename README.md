# PowerBank

A long project of power banks. 
 
## First a power bank for smartphone 
This power bank have an estimated capacity of 12 000 mAh.
Based on 18650 li-ion batteries, I stack 6 of them in parallel to obtain 12 000 mAh (6 * 2000) and a nominal voltage of 3.7V.
I used the IP5328P_V1.0 board, it's a board with charging and discharging features for li-ion batteries. This boards have over/under current protection and shortcut protection. The board is build to charge 1S battery at 3.7V with a maximum of 4.25V in charge and a minimum 3V0 in discharge. There is 4 LED to indicate the currrent capacity of the power bank when you click on the button.
For the differents ports you will have : 
- 2 output USB port 2A, 
- A USB C output and input with Quick Charge protocol (a blue LED indicates if the quick charge is active). 
- A MicroUSB charging port

You can download the Solidworks files to builds your own.

I don't take responsabilities of the risk you take with soldering the batteries and all electric danger
